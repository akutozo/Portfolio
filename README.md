# About the Author

My programming roots begin with MYSQL and PHP, when I ran small game called Legend of the Green Dragon. The game was a niche freeware application and a fun sandbox for a novice developer in the late 2000s and early 2010s. Working tech support at Verizon Wireless, I eventually transitioned to healthcare and quickly moved into an Operations Analyst position. Over the years I've had the pleasure of working with amazing developers who inspired me to pursue a one time hobby and build a career. 

I firmly believe that all problems have solutions and my hope this portfolio provides a small window into my mind, an example of my work and reveals a passionate, capable candidate worth investing in.
